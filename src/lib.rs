///
/// # Design
///
/// [`std::sync::Mutex`] has two purposes. It converts types that are [`Send`]
/// but not [`Sync`] into types that are both; and it provides
/// [interior mutability]. `bare_metal::Mutex`, on the other hand, only adds
/// `Sync`. It does *not* provide interior mutability.
///
/// This was a conscious design choice. It is possible to create multiple
/// [`CriticalSection`] tokens, either by nesting critical sections or `Copy`ing
/// an existing token. As a result, it would not be sound for [`Mutex::borrow`]
/// to return `&mut T`, because there would be nothing to prevent calling
/// `borrow` multiple times to create aliased `&mut T` references.
///
/// The solution is to include a runtime check to ensure that each resource is
/// borrowed only once. This is what `std::sync::Mutex` does. However, this is
/// a runtime cost that may not be required in all circumstances. For instance,
/// `Mutex<Cell<T>>` never needs to create `&mut T` or equivalent.
///
/// If `&mut T` is needed, the simplest solution is to use `Mutex<RefCell<T>>`,
/// which is the closest analogy to `std::sync::Mutex`. [`RefCell`] inserts the
/// exact runtime check necessary to guarantee that the `&mut T` reference is
/// unique.
///
/// To reduce verbosity when using `Mutex<RefCell<T>>`, we reimplement some of
/// `RefCell`'s methods on it directly.
///
/// ```
